While the Netherlands never exercised formal sovereignty over American territory, its banking institutions wielded considerable economic power over the development of Western cities.^1

Dutch investors gained substantial returns and exercised significant control over urban development, yet they remained largely invisible to Spokane's residents. This invisibility was both a feature and a vulnerability of financial colonialism—it could operate more smoothly than direct political control, but it also lacked the institutional permanence of formal empire.^5
