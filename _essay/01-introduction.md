In a full-page feature on January 31, 1931, Amsterdam's *Algemeen Handelsblad* hailed Spokane, Washington, as "The Playground of the Nation." It was a curious headline for a Dutch newspaper, yet the tagline offered an immediate explanation: "originally a trading post—Dutch bankers helped make the city great—wheat, apples, metals, and 'white coal'." The latter term was a direct reference to the hydropower of Spokane Falls, a resource that had become central to Dutch investment strategies in the American West. 

The article went to great lengths to familiarize its readers with this distant locale, asking them to "pronounce the name: Spokhin, not Spo-keen, as you learned in school." This linguistic correction suggested that the paper's readership would have a longstanding, perhaps even intimate, familiarity with the Washington city—enough to have learned a pronunciation, however incorrect, in their youth.

The author goes on to reference a popular joke between blackface characters Rastus and Sam performed in European music halls, illustrating just how pervasive the Dutch connection to Spokane had become in the cultural zeitgeist. "'Where is Spokane located' asks Rastus to Sam. The answer was: 'Somewhere in Holland'. Loud applause, everyone understood the joke." 

The humor relied on a widely acknowledged economic reality: "enterprising banks from the Netherlands were godparents at the birth of the new town in the Northwest of America."^1 This cultural artifact serves as a potent reminder of the invisible threads tying the American frontier to European capital.

To understand the depth of this financial entanglement, one must look back to the catastrophe that reshaped the city. On August 4th, 1889, a warm Sunday afternoon turned into a nightmare when a fire broke out downtown. 

The blaze was merciless. Fueled by dry summer winds and timber construction, it destroyed thirty-two blocks of downtown Spokane. In the span of a single evening, the fire effectively swept "the entire business portion of the city" away, leaving smoking ruins where banks and hotels had stood only hours before.^2

However, the destruction was almost immediately met with a frenzy of reconstruction. Self-mythologizing around the fire quickly became part of the narrative around the city. Local boosters and newspapers began comparing the event to the Great Chicago Fire, framing it not as a tragedy, but as a crucible that proved the city founder's "indomitable energy."

Public speeches and editorials poured forth, thanking the "rich men who came forward, and by their actions and liberal use of money inspired the confidence to make a city." The story being told was one of American grit, local resilience, and the triumph of the pioneer spirit against the elements.

Yet, there was a glaring omission in this triumphant history. Not included in this narrative was the fact that a small syndicate of Dutch financiers lent most of the capital involved in this rebuilding.^3 

While the faces of the recovery were American businessmen, the money fueling the brick and mortar reconstruction was flowing directly from Amsterdam. The "liberal use of money" celebrated in the press was, in large part, foreign debt.

This mortgage lending led to a startling economic reality: by 1896, following a period of economic contraction and receivership, Dutch interests owned twenty-five percent of Spokane. This included the majority of its downtown district. 

The scale of this ownership was a delicate matter. At the time, the Dutch company urged absolute discretion with this information. They feared their identity would be interpreted as a foreign-owned monopoly by "western radicals" in Spokane, potentially sparking populist backlash or legislative retaliation.^4

Contrary to both local booster narratives and traditional understandings of the post-Monroe Doctrine era, this paper argues that Spokane's development was not only a story of American enterprise but a complex case of overlapping colonialism. 

It contends that the settler colonial ambitions of American industrialists were supplanted by the predatory financial schemes and land acquisition of Dutch interests. This interest did not appear out of thin air; it originated with the new Dutch merchant class created by the 1870s Cape Era diamond boom. This surplus capital flowed first into American railway bonds and ultimately established a foreign-controlled financial market in the heart of the Inland Empire.

Between the fire of 1889 and the liquidation of Dutch assets in 1923, Spokane's aggressive public display of frontier iconography—its cowboys, its rough-and-tumble image—was less an expression of civic pride than a calculated cultural assertion. It was an American identity designed to obscure its complicated, foreign financial relationships.^5
