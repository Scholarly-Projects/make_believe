In a full-page feature on January 31, 1931, Amsterdam’s *Algemeen Handelsblad* hailed Spokane, Washington, as “The Playground of the Nation.” The tagline continued, “originally a trading post—Dutch bankers helped make the city great—wheat, apples, metals, and ‘white coal,’” referencing the hydropower of Spokane Falls that was so central to Dutch interests. The article asked readers to “pronounce the name: Spokhin, not Spo-keen, as you learned in school,” suggesting that the paper’s Dutch readership would have a longstanding familiarity with the Washington city. The author goes on to reference a popular joke between blackface characters Rastus and Sam performed in European music halls.^1 “‘Where is Spokane located’ asks Rastus to Sam. The answer was: ‘Somewhere in Holland’. Loud applause, everyone understood the joke. Because enterprising banks from the Netherlands were godparents at the birth of the new town in the Northwest of America.”^2  
On August 4th 1889, a fire destroyed thirty-two blocks of downtown Spokane, effectively sweeping “the entire business portion of the city” away.^3 Self-mythologizing around the fire quickly became part of the narrative around the city, comparing the event to the Chicago fire as an example of the city founder’s “indomitable energy” and thanking the “rich men who came forward, and by their actions and liberal use of money inspired the confidence to make a city.”^4

Not included in this narrative was the fact that a small syndicate of Dutch financiers lent most of the capital involved in this rebuilding.^5 This mortgage lending led to Dutch interests owning twenty-five percent of Spokane, including most of its downtown by 1896, after falling into receivership. At the time, the company urged discretion with this information, as they feared their identity would be interpreted as a foreign-owned monopoly by “western radicals” in Spokane.^6   

Contrary to both local booster narratives and traditional understandings of the post-Monroe Doctrine era, this paper argues that Spokane development was not only a story of American enterprise but a complex case of overlapping colonialism. It contends that the settler colonial ambitions of American industrialists were supplanted by the predatory financial schemes and land acquisition of Dutch interests. This interest, originating with the new Dutch merchant class created by the 1870s Cape Era diamond boom, flowed into American railway bonds and ultimately established a foreign-controlled financial market in Spokane. Between the fire of 1889 and the liquidation of Dutch assets in 1923, Spokane’s aggressive public display of frontier iconography was less an expression of civic pride than a cultural assertion of an American identity designed to obscure its complicated, foreign financial relationships.  

To understand this process, we need to analyze the layers of financial control and its relationships with cultural iconography. Drawing on international media, correspondence and archival documents, this paper traces the financial network that created this dynamic, highlighting how wealth from the 1870s Cape Era diamond boom constructed a new Dutch merchant class that invested in American railway bonds. Next, I demonstrate how this capital established a foreign-controlled financial market in Spokane, ultimately leading to the unseating of local industrialists through predatory lending and land acquisition. Finally, I analyze the cultural response to this foreign financial control, examining how Spokane's citizens used frontier iconography in parades, expositions, and commercial imagery to invoke a purely American identity, masking more complicated origins.  

This thesis builds on interdisciplinary approaches in environmental history, material culture studies, semiotics, and cultural history to examine how economic networks and commercial symbolism converged in the development of Spokane. Central to this framework is a model adapted from William Cronon, who analyzed regional development not through linear chronology but through escalating layers of commercial abstraction. These layers range from raw commodities like timber and grain to mediated forms such as mail-order catalogs and promotional expositions. This approach reveals how the ecological origins of production became increasingly abstracted as goods entered national and global trade routes, severing consumers from the material and social realities embedded in everyday objects.^7  

To address this growing disconnect, this project draws on scholars of material culture who use semiotics to decode the symbolic language of commerce. Particularly important are interpretations showing how retail packaging, trademarks, and advertising imagery functioned not merely as decoration but as “conjuring symbols,” evoking personal memory, cultural myth, and trust across widening distances between producers and consumers.^8 This semiotic lens has also been applied to booster literature and speculative cartography. In these contexts, promotional texts and maps encoded aspirational visions of place, transforming landscapes into commerce through narrative and visual rhetoric.^9  

The foundational scholarship on Dutch investment in Spokane comes from Eastern Washington University professor John Fahey. While Fahey’s work meticulously documents *what* Dutch investors acquired and *where* they invested in Spokane, this project explores *why* they chose this specific region and *how* capital flowed from the Netherlands to the Inland Northwest through international financial and promotional networks. Context is utilized through scholarly work providing an overview on Dutch global ventures, the introduction of American railway bonds in Amsterdam, and the new class of Dutch workers whose sudden wealth fueled overseas speculation.^10 This work also draws on research documenting the emergence of immigration departments within major railroads to boost foreign settlements and how their booster publications helped market this business model to foreign and domestic audiences.^11   

This paper situates Spokane within evolving ideologies of U.S. expansion. Research on settler colonialism and anti-imperial discourse helps contextualize the tension between America’s professed aversion to foreign entanglement and its own imperial practices, both continental and overseas.*^12* Contemporaneous Dutch-language accounts, including firsthand narratives from key financiers operating in Spokane, provide an external vantage point rarely captured in American sources.^13 Finally, non-scholarly resources are utilized to demonstrate how local historiography can transform corporate power into communal heritage over time, smoothing over edges that academic accounts can complicate.^14 This layered historiography allows the work new pathways to understand how Spokane was a uniquely international project, materially built and symbolically branded by Dutch capital.   

Spokane’s post-fire transformation was not a triumph of rugged American individualism but the product of financial influence that quietly supplanted local enterprise with foreign control. Far from contradicting the spirit of US expansion, these foreign interests overlapped with American imperial ambitions, leveraging the rhetoric of settler colonialism while consolidating economic power through mortgage banking, asset liquidation, and strategic obscurity. Beneath the city’s pervasive frontier iconography, disseminated through parades, expositions, and booster literature, was a performative assertion of American identity in reaction to a built environment made possible through international capital.
