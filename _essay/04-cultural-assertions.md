Civic celebrations, frontier iconography, and booster rhetoric all worked to establish the city as authentically Western and thoroughly American, even as Dutch bankers held the mortgage on much of its downtown.^5

The 1890s saw rising populist sentiment against Eastern banks and foreign capital. In this context, Spokane's business elite had strong incentives to minimize public awareness of Dutch ownership.^1
