# CB-ESSAY COLLECTION
#
# CB-Essay extends CollectionBuilder to support essay/monograph publishing alongside digital collections.
# Essays are Markdown files in the _essay/ folder with front matter controlling their display order.
#
# How it works:
# 1. Create .md files in _essay/ with front matter (title, order, optional byline)
# 2. Essays appear in sequential order based on the "order" field
# 3. Automatic prev/next navigation between essays
# 4. Choose essay or monograph theme in _data/theme.yml
#
# Learn more: docs/cb-essay/essay-writing.md
